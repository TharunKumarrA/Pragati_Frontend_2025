# Assets Directory

The `assets` directory is where you store other static assets that are not images or fonts, such as icons, SVG files, and other files needed by the app.

## Purpose
- Organize miscellaneous static assets that are part of the app's design or functionality.
- Make them accessible to the frontend without build processing.

## Usage
- Add any asset files (e.g., `.svg`, `.ico`, `.json`) that need to be referenced by components.
- Import or link to these files using their paths in the app (e.g., `<img src="/assets/icon.svg" alt="Icon" />`).
