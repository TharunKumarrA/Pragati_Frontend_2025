# Images Directory

The `images` directory is used to store image files such as logos, backgrounds, icons, and other static visual assets.

## Purpose
- Keep all image assets organized and accessible for use across the app.
- Store images that are loaded directly in components or pages without build processing.

## Usage
- Add image files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) to this directory.
- Use the `src` attribute in `img` elements or `background-image` properties to reference these images in your app's code.
