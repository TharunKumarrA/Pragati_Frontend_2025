# Utils Directory

The `utils` directory is used for utility functions and helper modules that support the application logic.

## Purpose
- Store reusable functions and code snippets that are used across multiple components or pages.
- Improve code modularity and maintainability by keeping utility code separate from component logic.

## Usage
- Create utility functions as needed and import them into your components or pages where they're used.
