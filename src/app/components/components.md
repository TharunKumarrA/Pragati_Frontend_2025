# Components Directory

The `components` directory is for reusable React components that can be imported into various pages or layouts.

## Purpose
- Modularize the application by creating components for common UI elements (e.g., buttons, form inputs, modals).
- Promote code reusability and a cleaner project structure.

## Usage
- Build small, focused components that encapsulate specific pieces of UI and logic.
- Import and use these components in your pages and layouts as needed.
