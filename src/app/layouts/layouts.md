# Layouts Directory

The `layouts` directory contains layout components that define the structure and presentation of different parts of the application.

## Purpose
- Layouts provide a consistent structure for the application, such as headers, footers, and navigation bars.
- You can create multiple layout files for different parts of the application, like a main layout for the whole app and specific layouts for sections.

## Usage
- Import and use a layout in your pages as needed to wrap the content and maintain consistent design.
